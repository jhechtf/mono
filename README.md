# Jhecht's Utility Mono Repo

This is a repo that holds all of my random projects.

## Projects

Currently there are 5 projects in the repo:

1. [ArkType Utils](#arktype-utils)
2. [Design Tokens](#design-tokens)
3. [Eslint Plugin](#eslint-plugin)
4. [Typescript Config](#typescript-config)
5. [Vite Plugin Design Tokens](#vite-plugin-design-tokens)

## ArkType Utils

[ArkType](https://arktpe.io) is a 1:1 TypeScript validation library. I utilize it heavily, so I created some wrapper utils around it

## Design Tokens

This is a port over of [jhechtf/design-tokens](https://github.com/jhechtf/design-tokens). The original project was written for
Deno, but with Deno basically becoming a sandbox for Node, I've decided to move the library over to Node fully, allowing for the
[Vite Plugin](#vite-plugin-design-tokens)

## Eslint Plugin

Common ESLint stuff I use.

## TypeScript Config

Common TypeScript Config I use for most projects

## Vite Plugin Design Tokens

WIP - added in eagerly.
